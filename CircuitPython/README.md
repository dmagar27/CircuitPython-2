My CircuitPython Assignments
# Fade
In this assignment, I made an LED fade in and out using pulseio and duty_cycle.
I also used time.sleep to determine how long the LED takes to get brighter and
how long it stays at it's brightest.
# Servo
In this assignment, I made a servo rotate back and forth. Eventually, I made it
rotate to one side when I touched a certain wire, and to the other side when I
touched a different wire. I used touchio, pusleio, and duty_cycle.
# LCD
In this assignment, I had the LCD display how many times a button had been
pressed, and whether it was counting up or down. I had to use three different
variables, and I also used DigitalInOut, Direction, and Pull.DOWN.
# Photointerrupter
In this assignment, I had my serial moniter count how many times the photointerrupter
had been interrupted. I used two variables as well as DigitalInOut, Direction, and Pull.UP.
# Distance Sensor
In this assignment, I made the board LED change color depending on the distance
read by the HCSR04. I had to use neopixel, one variable for the distance, and
three variables for the LED (red, green, and blue).
